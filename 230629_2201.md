# Modding in Empire Totalwar 

## Forenotice: 
I will talk about only how to make mods work on steam/linux. Not pathing or so.
Mod Packs Here: ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Empire Total War/data
Scripts Here: ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/Empire/AppData/scripts

## But How?

First get the pack file from internet. Most necessary modding packs are two bug
fixing pack files: town_fixing.pack and its companion the "port_gdp_3_b.pack"
(Why b? because author made two pack files and it gives advantageous to england
and france the first one, so we get b file. Also pack files need to have been
lowercase,change the name!!!)

Normally in windows you would write the names of these packs in
"user.empire_script.txt" but this doesn't work in linux as the linux version of
the game not looking this file (or do?, i am not sure, i will try later---edit:
i tried nope... even creating such a file with content it makes game crash). So
we will use the file "preferences.empire_script.txt"

1. just write the followings to the end of the file:
    ```
    mod town_fixing.pack;
    mod port_gdp_3_B.pack;
    ```
2. Also move the pack files to the 'data' (look Forenotice above for the place)
Don't forget to make 'pack' files executable with 'chmod +x filename'
if you're luck it works but generally you are not!!! :)

### Red Notice: file encodings

This `preferences.empire_script.txt` file is utf-16le file. you can't generally
save it in the right format. if you use an editor other than the "vim" you even
may not notice it. You have to open this file in the right encoding and save it
in the right encoding for it to work! How to do that?

#### How to open and save it with vim

Just open vim (not the file at first) and on the command line write the
following: `:set fencs=utf-16le` After that open the file, made the above
modifications and save it.

## Afternotice
You may probably make many other mod pack work. just don't try smoke or some
graphical ones. Hope you enjoy.
