# Saving an email which is attachable to other mails in neomutt 

When in mail, pressing e (editing or viewing raw email) opens the raw email.
Saving this raw file in *.eml* format to elsewhere and sending it as attachment
with another mail is all to do [@Savemail]. The attached eml formatted mail is visible in
webmail and also in outlook (as well Thunderbird etc.)

This mail also includes all attachments of the saved mail.
