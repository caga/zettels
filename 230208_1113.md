# Adding citations without actually using them in body text 

If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there:
```
nocite: |
	@Yakimov2017Nov, @Robertson2020May
	
```
This page is an example of the above situation.
It is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:

```
nocite: |
	@*
```
