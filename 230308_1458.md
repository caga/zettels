# Searching zettels with netrw 

Using grep or vimgrep for searching zettels and then using cfilter to the
output only filters already grepped lines. This may cause missing the searched
file(s).  To overcome this a vimscript may be written to simplify the grepping
and pattern or an alternative way using netrw file manager features. 

How to do that?:

1. grep the content with: `grep -i -I -d recurse "vim" *`
2. then in netrw mark files in quickfix list with qF
3. vimgrep between these files with new search key with `mg`
4. Goto step 1 until find the target file. 

Note: you can activate netrw with `:e .`  Though you may need a few extra
settings in your vimrc like **filetype plugin on** and **set nocompatible**
