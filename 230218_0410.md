# Why ctrl-i in vim does not work? 
This is because <Tab> and ctrl-i is deeply related. If <tab> is mapped to
something in your vimrc (ex: vimwiki maps it to link jumping) then your <ctrl-i>
also not work.[@ctrli] So you should remap if something broke your
configuration. Here is vimwiki remapping for that fix:

	nnoremap <Leader>nl <Plug>VimwikiNextLink
	nnoremap <Leader><S-n> <Plug>VimwikiPrevLink
