# Echoing messages in vim 
There are two commands in vim for that: `echo` and `echom`
You can always read full documentation by running `:help echo` and `:help echom` in Vim.

Try echo:

	:echo "Hello world!"
You should see `Hello world!` appear at the bottom of the window.

## Persistent Echoing

Now try out echom:

	:echom "Hello again, world!"
You should see `Hello again, world!` appear at the bottom of the window. 
To see the difference between these two commands, run the following:

	:messages

You see `Hello again, world!` but not the other one. 

When you're writing complex scripts in vimscript, this will help you to debug
your problems. `:echo` may disappear but using `:echom` will save the output
and let you run `:messages` to view it later. [@Loshbook2013Apr p. 1]
