# defining local directory as a package and use the scripts in it in python 

add an empty __init__.py file to the folder that your would use as a package.
Let's say its name is 'utils'

Then in your program call the modules by importing as the following:

```
from utils import prepare_env

a,b=prepare_env.get_api_key()
```

Here "prepare_env.py" is the file containing the 'get_api_key' function.
