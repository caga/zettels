# symlink 
symlink is something similar to shorcut in windows. It creates a link to another directory or a file. Can be created as follows:

	ln -s [path of the target file/directory] [symbolic name]
	
	ln -s ../data data
To remove it you can just use 'rm' command (there is also a unlink [symlink name])
To modify an existing symlink you may use the creation pattern but with -f (force) flag:

	ln -sf [path of the new target file/directory] [symbolic name]
