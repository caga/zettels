# Writing a booklet in caga documentbase system 
Joining a few notes together can be done with the following command:

	:!pandoc -f markdown -t pdf 230228_1010.md 230228_1013.md
	230309_2217.md 230309_2337.md 230310_0141.md -o pdf/den.pdf
	--lua-filter=$HOME/.bin/pandocFilters/links-to-pdf.lua --filter
	mermaid-filter --filter pandoc-crossref --citeproc --standalone

Here what should be pointed out is, no note should include the reference part
except the last one or it adds reference on all pages.

Document title is determined from the last note(zettel). So you need to prepare a last
dummy note including a reference part and the correct title of the booklet.

Manually it is a little bit hard to prepare such a command. An also a dummy
introduction note should be prepared (or generated). I should think about it.

A script can be written to wipe out the unnecessary parts of the standalone notes on the fly and feeding it into pandoc utility. 

Note: `--standalone` part in the command is for generating html documents
mainly instead of pdf. It does not matter in pdf booklets as far as i noticed.
