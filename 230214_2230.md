# Changing default application in linux system 
There should be a mimeapps.list somewhere in your linux system defining
the defaults. I personally could not find this main file in my system 
but a file 'usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache' which defines the 
system-wide defaults and their precedence. Also under the very same 
folder there are foo.desktop files of applications describing the 
programs mime types and so.... 


You can override them by creating a file under your config directory: 
'~/.config/mimeapps.list'. But you should define a foo.desktop just 
described above if there is not under the applications directory.



Anyways, you can define three sections in this file [@ArchXdgMimeApps]:

**Added Associations:** indicates that the application support opening 
that MIME type
**Remmoved Associations:** indicates that the applications don't 
support that MIME type.
**Default Applications:** indicates that the applications should be
the default choice for openning that MIME type.

Let's make zathura our first choice to open pdfs:

```bash
[Default Applications]

application/pdf=org.pwmt.zathura-pdf-mupdf.desktop;
org.pwmt.zathura-pdf-poppler.desktop;firefox-esr.desktop;
mupdf.desktop;
```
