# View mail attachments from mutt 

There is a python script for viewing attachments like docx files as well html
emails.[@ViewAtchInMutt]
Putting this script to system path (or local bin which is in your path) and
defining a mutt macro in your muttrc file (plese look:
[mutt-wizard file structure](230210_1016.md))  as follows is enough:
```
    macro index <F5> "<pipe-message>viewmailattachments.py\n" 
    "View all attachments in a browser"
   ```
