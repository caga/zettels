# Steno 

Steno or shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that incresases
speed and brevity of writing as compared to longhand, a more common method of
writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called
**stenography**, from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphein (to write).

Stenotype is the shorthand writing with a steno machine. 
Here is the English steno machine layout:

|   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | T | P | H | * | F | P | L | T | D |
| S | K | W | R | * | R | B | G | S | Z |
|   |   | A | O |   | E | U |   |   |   |

On a normal keyboard, a typist hits individual keys to express individual
letters as fast as possible to spell words. A stenographer- on the other hand,
uses a steno machine to make "chords" by hitting multiple keys. Chords, much
like the ones played on a piano, express sounds instead of letters and allow
the stenographer to type at a slower rate to achieve the same word count,
because those chords can express entire words and phrases. The result is about
three times faster than traditional typing.  

A stenoraphy setup consists of a steno machine and steno software running on a
computer.[^old] The machine can either be specially made for steno, or just an
ordinary keyboard that supports n-key rollover (hitting all the keys at once.)
The software that si most commonly used by amateurs is kplover, which listens
to what you do on the steno machine and then outputs keystrokes to whatever
program you're using.

[^old]: Before computers existed, stenographers wrote to "paper tape" which
only captured which keys were hit on the machine. After transcribing, the
stenographer would have to go back and convert their "notes" into text, very
much like pen shorthand. Nowadays, translation from key press to text is
instant.

## Key concepts 
Steno is completely different from traditional typing. It takes months to learn
and years to master. Let's look at some of the key concepts that make
stenography special.

### Chords 
The steno machine's compressed layout is used to form *chords*, which loosely
correspond to *syllables*[^2]. Steno feels a lot like playing a piano, and
stenographers map between "steno speak" and "the English language."

[^2]: The reason i keep saying "syllables, loosely" is that the text
representation of a chord is often unpronounceable. For example, `N-L` for
"until" has no vowel; `SDAOIN` for "design" has an unpronounceable `SD`; and
the chord to backspace the previous chord is just the `*` key which can't be
pronounced.
