# Pandoc Citation 
This document we will give basic citation and footnote referancing in a markdown document
to be processed with pandoc later. We will cover the concepts described in the referenced video [@TheoryToE2022Apr]

And also as we use crossref you may always check its documents [@Yakimov2017Nov]

## FootNote Referencing
We can also give a footnote [^1]

[^1]: Important subject is footnote.

Also note that we can use pagebreaks by simply inserting '\break' in text without quotes but it spills the markdown also breakdown the footnote place 

## Referencing Equations

Let's try some math:
$$ x^2+2x=y $$ {#eq:simpleq}

And just under the equation lets give a reference to it: 'As you can see in equation (@eq:simpleq)

Above crossreferencing is done by filter pandoc-crossref writing before the citeproc, just like told in the video of Brodie Robertson [@Robertson2020May]. 

## Table Referencing
| X | Y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |

Table: Results related to my line. {#tbl:line}

Here as show in table (@tbl:line), this is done like that!

## Referencing Figures
There maybe figures in content like:

![Humans](figures/fig.jpg){#fig:fig1 width=75%}

So here you see the figure (@fig:fig1)
