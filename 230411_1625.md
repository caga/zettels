# Pathlib library 

Pathlib library is a relatively new library comparing to `os` library. It was introduced in Python F.H and offers a different set of abstractions for working with paths. You should absolutely use it if your program required to be also work on Windows.

In pathlib the path is formed using the wivision operator `/` with an initialized `Path` object:

```
from pathlib imort import Path
path=Path.home()/ 'data' / 'file.txt'
# /User/adam/data/file.txt
```
The `Path` object ist the ocus of pathlib. Almost all of the functinality we need can be accessed as either attributes or methods on this object.


## Getting the home directory

The home directory is in different places on different operatin systems. Both our contenders offer a way to get the user's home directory tha will work on both UNIX and Windows systems (but as i mentioned above, one should choose pathlib over os if he wants his program works on windows,IMHO)
```
import os
os.path.expanduser('~')
# /Users/adam
```
