# Basic mapping 

Perhabs vim's one of the greatest feature as a text editor is the ability of
mapping some functions to keys. You do this with the `:map` word.

As a default 'x' deletes char in normal mode in vim. let's map also `-` do this:

	:map - x

You may notice this mapping does not work in editing mode surprisingly. Maybe
vim's default map is normal-mode if anything different specified.

## Special characters
You can use <keyname> to thell vim about special keys.

    :map <space> viw
You can also map keys like Ctrl and Alt:

    :map <c-d> dd
    :map <a-d> viw
    
## Commenting
Mapping keys is one of the places where vim comments don't work.

    :map <space> viw "Select word
 
Trying this will make a very interesting thing. Besides adding comment into text, a recursion occurs.
 
## Exercises
 
 - map `-` key to `dd` then paste it below the one we're on now. This will let
   you move lines downward in your file with one keystroke.  **References:**
 - Figure out how to map the `_` key to move the line up instead of down.
 - Add that mapping to your _vimrc_
