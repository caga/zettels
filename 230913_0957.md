# How price forms
Price is the proportional to  the ratio of supply and demand.
In mathematical terms:

$$
Price= \bm{\alpha} \frac{Demand}{Supply}
$$ {#eq:price}

Here $\bm{\alpha}$ can be approximated from statistical data of supply and demand,
providing that price data is also available. This formulation is simple yet
powerful as it can be used as the first step calculating the required money
supply to the economy to stabilize the prices.

Also may be used to forecast a price in a financial market even in crypto money
markets.
