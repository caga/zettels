# Login to binance with binance-connector library 

Firs you need to create a apikey from your binance account. You need to download the application and follow the orders there (You may try to use Openssh to generate a rsa key, adding -----BEGIN API KEY---- and -----END API KEY----- headers, but somehow it gives error so ...)

After that you will have three keys:

* Private rsa key
* Public rsa key 
* Api key

You will use api key and private key to logon to your account. Here is an example code:

```python
#RSA authentication with RSA key

api_key="ehanstcioatsnieanhciteseah"
with open("/home/osman/kg/Private_key", "r") as f:
    private_key=f.read()

client=Client(
        api_key,
        private_key=private_key
        )
logging.info(client.account())
print(client.account())
```
