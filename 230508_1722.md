# creating symbolic links in vifm 

There are two command and two shortcut keys for absolute and relative symbolic
links. First copy the file/directory and then press `al` or `rl` or type :alink
or :rlink in commandline in where you want to create the symbolic link. You may
thing creating absolute symbolic links as they can be moved, but i don't know.
