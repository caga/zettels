# How to prepare a bootable usb or block device from iso 

Infact it is a very simple process. First [determine the block device name](230209_0046.md) of the usb (let's say sdx) then if this disk is already bootable, it should be [converted to normal](230209_0035.md) again! After that you can use on of the following commands 

* using cat:
	
	cat path/to/iso > /dev/sdx
* using cp
	
	cp path/to/iso /dev/sdx
* using dd

	dd bs=4M if=path/to/iso of=/dev/sdx conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
