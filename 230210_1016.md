# mutt-wizard file structure 


Main configuration files including 'mutt-wizard.muttrc' and mail.cap files is in 
'/usr/share/mutt-wizard'.

For user a **muttrc** configuration file is created and can be used under '~/.config/mutt/muttrc'. Custom macros can be written in that file.

This file sources the above 'mutt-wizard.muttrc' and also another automatically created
conf file for the user under "~/.config/mutt/accounts/'username@emaildomain.muttrc'"

It is also conveniant to create a separate [mailcap file](230207_1123.md) under '~/.config/mutt/' and do stuff in it.

Mails are kept under folder which can be seen in the username@maildomain.muttrc file under **set folder** variable.

    set folder = "/home/osman/.local/share/mail/cagatay.cakir@sanayi.gov.tr"
