# Cfilter 
Cfilter is a very usefull command to filter quickfix results. To use the Cfilter 
you should add the following line to your *.vimrc* file or execute command in your vim buffer:
	
	:packadd cfilter


After a grep search (for example the term 'vim' in our notes) our ql is full with results. 
Now we can filter the results many times for other terms like 'vimrc' or 'grep'
to refine our results.

Please look to the reference @advancevim and vim manual for cfilter *(in vim type ':h cfilter')* for deeper knowledge.
