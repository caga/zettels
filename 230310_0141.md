# Modal mapping 

The `map` command makes the keys work in `normal` mode and also in `visual` mode.
We can be more specific about modes when making mappings using `nmap`,`vmap`,
and `imap`. This tells vim to only use the mapping in normal mode, visual mode
or insert mode, respectively. Example:

	:nmap - dd
	:vmap - U
	
Above example, `-` deletes the row in normal mode while in visual mode it upper
case the letter on which the cursor stands

# Insert Mode

Let's do a mapping:

	:imap <c-d> dd
You may think this mapping will delete the current line while in insert mode,
but it puts `dd` instead. This is because `dd` command only works in normal
mode!
To make it work as we wanted, we should change it like this:

	:imap <c-d> <esc>ddo

`o` at the end return us to insert mode a new line.

## Exercises
- Set up a mapping so that you can press <c-u> to convert the current word to uppercase when you're in insert mode. Remember that `U` in visual mode will uppercase the selection. 
- Add above mapping to your _vimrc_
- Set up a mapping so that you can uppercase the current word with <c-u> when in normal mode.
- Add above mapping to your _vimrc_
